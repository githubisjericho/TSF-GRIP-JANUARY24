The Sparks Foundation -Graduation Rotational Internship Program
This repository is dedicated to the completion of all my tasks from The Sparks Foundation (Graduate Rotational Internship Program).
As of now, I will be updating the tasks from my domain : Data Science and Business Analytics for the January 2024 batch.

Tools/IDE : Python/Jupyter Notebook


### Technical : **Task 1** - Prediction using Supervised ML 
Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours.
This is supposed to be done with linear regression as we will be using just 2 variables. Data for this model can be found at : http://bit.ly/w-data.

What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the score of the student if he/she studies for 9.25 hrs/day.

### Technical : **Task 2** - Prediction using Unsupervised ML 
Predict the optimum number of clusters, from the given "iris" dataset and represent it visually.
I will be implementing this with the help of K-Means Clustering algorithm. Dataset for this model can be found at : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox.

What are we supposed to do with the given dataset?
We need to predict the optimum number of clusters and it's visualization.
